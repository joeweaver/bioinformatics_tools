# Drop off for scripts and tools
This repository serves mainly to collect bioinformatics related tools and scripts as I write them.

Some may be useful, some may be half baked.  Some may work after adapting them a bit to address whatever problem was not-quite similar to the one I wrote the tool for.

No gauarantees of stablity, etc.
